**ANIMAL FUN FACTS*

In this project I create a *React Application* where users will be able to click on underwater sea animal to recieve a fun fact about them. 

To complete this project I will use knowledge of JSX like create JSX elements using element attributes, using click handlers and conditional rendering.
